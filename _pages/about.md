I'm a 5th year Ph.D. student advised by Professor [Tai Sing Lee](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/). My main research interests are using and developing neural network-based models to explain computation mechanisms underlying low-level visual cortex of primates, as well as general machine learning and computer vision problems.
