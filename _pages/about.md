I'm a final year Ph.D. student advised by Professor [Tai Sing Lee](http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~tai/). My main research interests are using and developing neural network-based models to explain computation mechanisms underlying lower visual areas of primates, as well as general machine learning and computer vision problems.

I enjoy working on engineering problems requiring a balance of theoretical knowledge and engineering expertise in ML/CV/AI. I will join [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) after graduation. [Résumé](http://zym1010.github.io/files/cv/resume.pdf)
